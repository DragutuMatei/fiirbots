      content="  The “FIIR_Bots” is a motivated team, which was established this year
      due to the desire of students to be involved in practical activities,
      research and individual study outside the hours provided in the
      education plan. The team is composed of 14 passionate students and a
      mentor from the Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Robotics
      (F.I.I.R) within the National University of Science and Technology
      POLITEHNICA Bucharest (U.N.S.T.P.B.). These enthusiastic and talented
      young people bring with them a range of skills and experience in
      robotics and industrial engineering."
